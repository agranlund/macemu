Build with Vincent Rivi√®re's GCC 4.6.4
http://vincent.riviere.free.fr/soft/m68k-atari-mint/

Some host version of GCC is needed to build a few tools.


Todos:

General:
  ether_atari
  extfs_atari
  serial_atari
  scsi_atari

Disk:
  - CDRom support

Sound:
  - Sound not working in SoundManager 3.2.1+

  - Sound issues in general. Specifically, some software cannot detect when
    sounds have finished playing, ending up waiting forever.
    (Prince of Persia is a good example)


68060 FPU:
  - We need to integrate the 060 rom patches from Amiga Shapeshifter.
    The Motorola support software is present but we still need to integrate
    some of the 060 rom patches from Amiga Shapeshifter (frestore has a
    different stack frame compared to 040)
