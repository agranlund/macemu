Build with Vincent RiviÃ¨re's GCC 4.6.4
http://vincent.riviere.free.fr/soft/m68k-atari-mint/

Some host version of GCC is needed to build a few tools.


Todos:

General:
  - The code needs tidying up...
  - Implement:
      ether_atari
      extfs_atari
      serial_atari
      scsi_atari

Disk:
  - Implement a decent disk cache
  - CDRom support

Sound:
  - Sound not working in SoundManager 3.2.1+

  - Sound issues in general. Specifically, some software cannot detect when
    sounds have finished playing, ending up waiting forever.
    (Prince of Persia is a good example)


68060 FPU:
  - We need to integrate the 060 rom patches from Amiga Shapeshifter.
    The Motorola support software is present but we still need to integrate
    some of the 060 rom patches from Amiga Shapeshifter (frestore has a
    different stack frame compared to 040)



Bugs:


CT60:
	Tested in 928x720 resolution

	060 graphics emulation. Runs but there are MMU issues.
	also it doesnt seem really stable....
	after a crash, 060 caches are off... not always, thats the odd part

	basilisk start, exit at dialog = cache off
		btw, its exit code which disable caches... hope it dont disable them just before basilisk run ðŸ˜‰

	and another oddness: last few attempts to do all speed tests  failed, as speedometer crashed to TOS....
	lcii, quadra, both roms, mmu/cmp on or off.



928*720
